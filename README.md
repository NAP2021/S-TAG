# S-TAG
Many times we misplace our things and go searching for them everywhere in the house, and after a long search, we end up finding them with much distress. So, in this project, we are going to build a IoT-based Smart TAG using NODE MCU, GPS module,Buzzer, Battery etc. Now in case if you canâ€™t find your keys and you remember that you have attached an SMART TAG to your valuables, so you take out your phone and open Chrome and open your S-tag Webpage. Then you click on the toggle button, and in moments, you hear a beep sound coming from your tag and with this, you will get the gps coordinates of your device and in turn can easily track your things.
